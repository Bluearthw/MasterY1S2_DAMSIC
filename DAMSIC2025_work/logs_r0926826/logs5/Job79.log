Begin Incremental Netlisting Mar 21 13:12:09 2025
WARNING (OSSHNL-225): The design variable 'vb7', used in the last netlisting session in the current
run directory is not used in this netlisting session. The netlist(s) generated
in the last netlisting session cannot be reused for incremental netlisting.
Therefore re-netlisting the design.

WARNING (ADE-6003): Terminal "Vb1", specified in the CDF termOrder, does not exist
           in the cell-view "DAMSIC" "symmetrical" "schematic"
WARNING (ADE-6004): Mismatch was found between the terminals in the cellView and those on the
           termOrder property on the CDF. Because of the mismatch, the CDF termOrder will
           be ignored. The terminals in the cellView will be netlisted in the alphabetical
           order of their names. Eliminate the mismatch if you want the CDF termOrder
           property to be used for netlisting.
           To edit CDF of a cell, 
           i) Open CIW->Tools->CDF->Edit.
           ii) Select Library Name & Cell Name.
           iii) Click on the Edit button in the simulation information section of the
                Edit CDF window.
